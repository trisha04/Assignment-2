HDFS cluster has a name node which manage the file system metadata and data node.Data nodes are those which manage the actual data.
Some features of HDFS are as follows:

Hadoop is written in java and is supported in all the major platforms
It supports shell like commands so that it can interact with HDFS directly
It is highly configurable with default configuration that are suited for many installations
It is suited for distributed storage


Hadoop cluster
They are comprised of three nodes types:
Master node-oversee the following key operations that comprise Hadoop storing data in HDFS
Worker node-make up the most of virtual matchines and store data and running computations
Client node-loads data into the cluster and submit the map redued job emphasising on the way the data shoud be processed.

HDFS Blocks
HDFS stores data in form of unit known as blocks.These blocks are of large size.
It is 64 MB of size and stored into hadoop system.
Advantages of HDFS blocks:
Blocks are of fixed size therefore it is very easy to calculate the number of blocks
Block concept simplifies the datanode storage.Namenode maintains metadata of all the blocks
Suppose the size of file is less than the complete block size the file will not occupy the complete storage
It is also useful when size of file is larger than the block size as data blocks distributed and stored in multiple nodes
Blocks are very easy to replicate between the data nodes
